    <string name="how_it_works_p0">We use the Bluetooth signal to anonymously detect the devices that get closer than 2 meters to you,
    and the time the two devices have been interacting for.</string>

    <string name="how_it_works_p2">We only save the interactions between your phone and the other devices,

    <string name="how_it_works_p3">Only professional medical staff can diagnose if a patient is positive to the virus.
        In that case, the doctor will scan the patient\'s QR code and notify the people that are at risk because
        they have been interacting with the infected patient.</string>

    <string name="how_it_works_q4">What happens if you receive the notification that you could be at risk?</string>
    <string name="how_it_works_p4">It means that you have been interacting with someone that has tested positive.
